long-description = "This library is an attempt to implement UUIDs to the RFC 9562 standard located here: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9562.html\n\nAs of this writing it can identify any UUID's version or variant and create any kind of UUID in the spec:\n* UUIDv1: Gregorian Timestamp with constant data\n* UUIDv3: MD5-hashed\n* UUIDv4: Randomly-generated\n* UUIDv5: SHA1-hashed\n* UUIDv6: Gregorian Timestamp with constant data with better database locality \n* UUIDv7: UNIX Timestamp with random data, optimized for database locality\n* UUIDv8: Custom UUIDs\n\nAll of my unit tests are passing, but am open to more tests plus additional validation on other platforms, especially big endian.\n\nRefer to the [UUIDs Readme](https://github.com/AJ-Ianozi/uuids) for full description.\n\nYou can also read the [full API documentation](https://aj-ianozi.github.io/uuids/toc_index.html) which has been generated with [ROBODoc](https://github.com/gumpu/ROBODoc).\n\n"
